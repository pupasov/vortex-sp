The project contains Mathematica nb files with calculations of Smith-Purcell radiation by a vortex electron. 

Charge density and currents related with the wave function of a Gauss-Laguerre wave packet produce electric and magnetic fields. 
File FourierTransformVortexElectron-Public.nb provides calculations of the Fourier integrals.

The resulting Fourier integrals of the electron field are used in the file Generalized-currents-and-radiation-VortexElectron-Public.nb 
to calculate surface currents induced on the ideally conducting difraction grating and finally to calculate angular and spectral distributuion of radiation intensity.
